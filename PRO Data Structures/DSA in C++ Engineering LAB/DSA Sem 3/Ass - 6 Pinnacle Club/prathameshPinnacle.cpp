/*
The first node is reserved for the president of the club
and the last node is reserved for the secretary of the club. Write C program to maintain club
memberâ€Ÿs information using a doubly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to
a) Add and delete the members as well as the president or even secretary.
b) Compute the total number of members of the club
c) Display members of the club
d) Display list in reverse order using recursion
